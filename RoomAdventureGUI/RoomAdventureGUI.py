'''
RoomAdventureGUI.py Enhancements

1) extra parsable words, probably not extra grammar, though
2) extra command, [use]
3) extra list of items that do not show up when surveying the room,
   but can still be looked
4) extra rooms, in a "third," "vertical" dimension
5) custom room names
6) objects that can be interacted with (requires #2)
7) small optimizations to code (e.g. verb in ["look", "get"]
   vs verb == "look" or verb == "get")
8) noun shortcuts (i.e. you don't have to type the whole noun)
9) extra, modified death option
10) slight grammar and aesthetic modification to Room().__str__
11) descriptions for grabbables, which also are removed from the room and
    brought with you if the grabbable is picked up.
