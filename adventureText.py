adventureText.py Enhancements

1)  extra parsable words, probably not extra grammar, though
2)  extra command, use (maybe others? not sure)
3)  extra list of items that do not show up when surveying the room,
    but can still be looked
4)  extra rooms, in a "third" dimension
5)  custom room names
6)  objects that can be interacted with (requires #2)
7)  small optimizations to code
    (e.g. verb in ["look", "get"] vs verb == "look" and verb == "get")
8)  directional shortcuts (i.e. "north" and "n" vs "north")
    (no shortcuts past that, though; I don't know how to compare match quality)
9)  extra, modified death() function
10) slight grammar modification to Room().__str__
11) ability to send empty commands without reprinting the room
12) descriptions for grabbables, which also are removed from the room and
    brought with you if the grabbable is picked up.
